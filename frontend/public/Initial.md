# üß™ Welcome to the Chemical Analysis & Generation Assistant!

I can help you analyze and generate molecular structures using various computational chemistry tools. Here's what I can do:

## üìä Analysis Tools
- **Analyze molecules** using SMILES notation 
- **Explore proteins** using PDB IDs
- **Examine polymers** using PSMILES notation

## üîç Similarity Search
- Find similar molecules from SMILES
- Discover related polymers
- Search for similar proteins in PDB

## üß¨ Generate New Structures
- Create molecules using BRICS algorithm
- Generate polymers with LSTM
- Design new structures using graph-based methods

## Example Queries:
1. "What are the properties of molecule CC(=O)?"
2. "Find similar molecules to CCCC(=O)CC"
3. "Show me details about protein 1AKE"
4. "Generate 5 new polymers using LSTM"

Just describe what you'd like to analyze or generate, and I'll help you use the appropriate tools!

Note: 
- For molecule analysis, provide SMILES notation
- For protein analysis, provide PDB IDs
- For polymer analysis, provide PSMILES notation
